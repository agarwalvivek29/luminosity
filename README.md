# EdTech AI Learning Platform

## 🚀 Revolutionizing Education with AI Agents

Welcome to the **EdTech AI Learning Platform**, a cutting-edge educational technology platform that leverages a **Mixture of Agents Architecture** to provide an unparalleled learning experience. Unlike traditional AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, or DeepSeek, which primarily focus on theoretical knowledge and Python-based execution, our platform **empowers students across multiple disciplines, including Electronics, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry**.

## 🎯 Why We Built This?
Current AI learning tools are limited in their ability to assist students in fields requiring **specialized computational tools**, particularly in **Electronics, Circuit Design, Chip Design, and Advanced Mathematics**. Students often struggle with:
- The need to **download large proprietary software**.
- Limited AI support for **hardware-related disciplines**.
- Lack of **interactive visualization tools** for complex subjects.

Our solution? **A fully integrated AI-driven sandbox with powerful open-source tools**, allowing students to **design, simulate, and visualize** their projects without expensive software or hardware constraints.
